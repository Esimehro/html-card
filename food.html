      <h3>Origin of Groundnut soup - Omisagwe</h3>
      <p>
        Groundnut is a yummy Nigerian soup made with Groundnut (Peanuts). Groundnut soup is a very popular delicacy in
        some Southern parts of Nigeria. Groundnut soup is particularly common amongst the Etsako people of Edo state. It
        is known as Omisagwe to the Etsakos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Groundnut soup can be made with or without vegetable leaves and it can be thickly or a watery consistency.
        Bitter leaves are used for groundnut soup traditionally but it can be replaced with Ugwu or Spinach leaves where
        bitter leaves are unavailable.

      <h3>Method to prepare Groundnut soup - Omisagwe</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In a medium-sized pot, Season and boil assorted meat with chopped onions, salt and seasoning.</li>
        <li>Dry roast the groundnut and uziza seed for 3 minutes in a frying pan shaking the pan regularly. I find that
          roasting spices and nut in a pan release oils and intensifies the flavour.</li>
        <li>Blend the groundnut and the uziza seeds until you achieve finely textured powder and set aside. The longer
          you blend, you will notice the powder transforming into a paste. This is as a result of the oils in the nuts
          and seeds. Roughly blend the pepper and set aside.</li>
        <li>When the meat is tender, shred stockfish into bits and add.</li>
        <li>Add the pepper in the assorted meat stir and let it boil properly. This should take 3 minutes, taste and add
          salt and seasoning if necessary. It is now time to include a reasonable amount of palm oil. I prefer 2 spoons
          of palm oil.</li>
        <li>Add the groundnut powder and 1/2 soup hot water. Note that the Palm oil and pepper stock must be bubbly
          while adding the groundnut powder.</li>
        <li>Let it boil for 10 minutes and watch as the soup thickens. If you are left with a watery consistency, simply
          add extra powder.</li>
        <li>Add a handful of efinrin, stir let it this cook for 2 minutes under low heat stir again.</li>
        <li>Serve with pounded yam /garri/fufu/wheat.</li>
      </ol>
